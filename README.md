# College_Project

This project saves projects and homeworks that finished during studying online open courses.

All projects are finished on my own. Since these are all homework projects, and I referred to many other people's ideas during the completion process, I claim no copyright for any code in this project, and all the content and codes can be used at will, no need to tell me. For some interesting or worthwhile projects, I will also write my thoughts in the readme.md of each project. Friends who love computer science like me are welcome to exchange experiences.

Since I started by self-studying computer science, many codes may not be standardized. If you have any suggestions, you are welcome to leave comments. P.S. After self-studying for a period of time, I came to the United States to study MSCS and am in the process of becoming a professional student. :)

另外, 我来自中国, 也可以用汉语交流.
