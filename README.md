# College_Project

This project saves projects and homeworks that finished during studying online open courses.

All projects are finished on my own. Since these are all homework projects, and I referred to many other people's ideas during the completion process, I claim no copyright for any code in this project, and all the content and codes can be used at will, no need to tell me. For some interesting or worthwhile projects, I will also write my thoughts in the readme.md of each project. Friends who love computer science like me are welcome to exchange experiences.

## Disclaimer (IMPORTANT)

The content of this project is provided for other students taking the open course for reference. If you are currently enrolled in this course and intend to submit assignments for grading, please do not use the code provided here. Complete the work on your own to fully benefit from the learning experience. If you plagiarize or commit academic misconduct resulting in failing the course or expulsion from your institution, I am not responsible.

If you are an instructor or other relevant personnel from related educational institution and believe I need to remove the code to prevent student plagiarism, please contact me directly, and I will be happy to comply.

To reiterate: I am sharing these codes for those interested in taking the open course and looking for reference answers.
